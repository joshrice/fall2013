title: I Came, I Saw, I Used a Flask

Must be something in the water because I didn't have any major issues installing and getting Flask up and running. I installed and cloned Flask with no issues at all. I got the site up and running on my local host and was able to login easily. <br \> I created my about.html page and added the route in flaskr.py. I ended up getting the same template error that Kyle mentioned in the Google Plus community. Shout out to Grant for providing a quick fix! Turns out I was missing a {! Silly typos! But once that was fixed, I was able to get a site up and working. Admittedly, it's not pretty, but it's functional!
