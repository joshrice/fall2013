title: Dave's command Line Post

My daily work is primarily at the command line, so this is all pretty familiar. 
Having the git commands on the class webpage is very helpful, but I also like this sheet:

Part way through the process, I decided to change the name of my post, which required ``` git rm 2013-10-14-newpost.md ``` and
``` git add 2013-10-14-commandline-post.md ```.
