##Post From the Command Line

Lots and lots accomplished with this post!

First, this post was sent through my local repository on my SILS hack TARDIS to the site. That is actually pretty straight forward. Once you set up the origin and upstream it is just a matter of keeping the Git model straight in your head. Also before any of your messing around make sure your copy of FALL2013 is the latest update from SILSHACK through a pull request to your local repository. 

The hardest part was actally getting Jekyll up and running on my machine. No matter how many times I tried to uninstall Ruby 1.8.7 and install Ruby 1.9.3, it just wasn't working, and without 1.9.3 github-pages doesn't work. The solution came through some Googling and eventualy finding this [link](http://leonard.io/blog/2012/05/installing-ruby-1-9-3-on-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pengolin/), which deals with installing Ruby on Ubuntu 12.04. Now my local Jekyll is up and running as shown through the following screenshot.
