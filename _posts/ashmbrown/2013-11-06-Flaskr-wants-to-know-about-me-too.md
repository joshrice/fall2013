Hey all,

Here is my about page!  Thanks to Kyle for posting an issue I kept having to the google plus community, and to Grant for helping us all find solutions. 

I tried messing with the CSS, but for some reason it doesn't seem to be working.  I'll mess around with it more this weekend (especially since it might become a component of my project).

And now for the long awaited screenshot...
