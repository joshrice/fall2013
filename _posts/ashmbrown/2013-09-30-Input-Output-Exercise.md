Greetings programmers-to-be,

I’ve attached my screenshots for today’s in-class assignment.   Today was a bit of a struggle for me.  I don’t think it helps that I have a nasty head cold that is also not allowing me to process information as well.  Additionally, I get overwhelmed when it seems like others are picking this up way faster than I am.  However, today I appreciated our discussion about breaking things into smaller pieces and taking it step-by-step.  And I think step-by-step is also how I will slowly but surely will start to understand things.  I need to do things several times before they click – so that means writing the same pieces of code and doing the same exercises over and over again. 

Anyway, enough babbling on my part… here are my screenshots:
