This week, we created a new jekyll site from the terminal. I was surprised by how few steps it took to create the site. 

It was also a good to create another github repository for this site. A review on setting the origin and master branches was great to reinforce the setting up the basics. 

Once the site was created and I viewed the page, I saw that the css was not working properly. To fix it, I had to add a reference to the proper directory within the index to refer to the proper location. Thanks -- baseurl made all the difference. 

After that was working, I wanted to play around with the css -- especially the colors. I love how colors are represented in number and letter form. I went in and put in random values for all the nice simple values like "#ddd" that were contained in the original css. The following is what I ended up with!
