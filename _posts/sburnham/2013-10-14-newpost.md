## First Command Line Post

In class on Monday, we went through the process of committing our first post from the command line.

The first thing we did during that process was to install Ruby. My understanding is that we needed to do this so that we could later install Jekyll so that we can preview using a local host. This will allow us to view a preview version of the site that looks like our github pages site. 

When I attempted to install Github-pages, I like many classmates had trouble. I installed only Jekyll, and was able to complete the command line post and preview. 

I cloned a version of our class website on my local computer and assigned upstream to be: 
```
http://github.com/silshack/fall2013.git
```
Then, I assigned origin to be:
```
origin git@github.com:sbbreen/fall2013.git
```
This allows me to use master and orgin as the to refer to these locations. 

The next step was to create a post in the proper directory and folder. Using the tab key was useful because it was able to auto complete the folder names. This naming structure was exactly the same as how we did it on the github website. 

To stage the post, we used the command git add filename. The next step is to git commit. When committing, you leave a message using -m "message". 

After committing, I used Jekyll local host to preview my post (at the default 4000 post). If the post looks good, the last step is to push the changes to my site. At first, I thought this was the same creating a pull request from my site on github to the class site on github, but then I learned that this just committed my changes to my version of the site, then I still had to open a pull request frmo my github site to the class github site. 

All in all, I thought this was a very successful assignement. Though its a few steps, all of our practive over the past couple of weeks has made it easy for me to understand what I am doing with each step!
