So, creating a post from the command line gave me a few problems right from the start.  
Following the instructions left me with the wrong version of Ruby, but when I removed it and got Ruby 1.9.3 instead, terminal was still showing I had the old version.
Grant helped me fix it (Thank you Grant!), because the old dev and gems needed to be remove to before 1.9.3 could be used.  

After that I just followed the instructions in the class notes to:
*  clone my class site
*  adding the class site as a remote upstream
*  writing a post in nano
*  adding and commiting the post
*  previewing the local version
*  pushing the post and creating a pull request


And here's a screenshot of some of that process in Terminal:
