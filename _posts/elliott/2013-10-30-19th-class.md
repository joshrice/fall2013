## Assignment Due Monday: Lightning Talk

To get a sense of what everyone's interested in for their final projects, we'll do lightning talks.  These are 1-2 minute presentations.  The topis can be one of the following:

* A class project idea you have
* An example project you've found that interests you
* An open source project that you might like to use in your final project.

The basic categories of project are: 
* Build a Linux system that does something interesting (like serve a webpage)
* Use an Open Source web framework to build a webpage (and ideally deploy it())
* Build an open source software project (e.g. in Python)
* Use an open source software project to build something (e.g. pygame)

Check out [starpusher](http://www.pygame.org/project-Star+Pusher+(Sokoban+clone\)-1900-.html) for an interesting hackable game.
